      Signal Info requires the `Phone` permission in order to detect connectivity changes. When such even occurs, the app logs data such as, but not limited to, time of the event’s occurrence, WiFi or cell signal name, time zone. Those logs are saved on the device, and are not stored or shared anywhere else.

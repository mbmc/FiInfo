      Signal Info requires the `Phone` permission in order to detect connectivity changes. When such even occurs, the app logs data such as, but not limited to, time of the eventâ€™s occurrence, WiFi or cell signal name, time zone. Those logs are saved on the device, and are not stored or shared anywhere else.
